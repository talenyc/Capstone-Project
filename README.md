# Project 5: Capstone

The Capstone Project for the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree 

Department of Education collects data from universities on students who apply for financial aid, this is publicly available data that can help students determine best college selection.  Choosing a college to attend can be difficult task given vast options available. This choice is ever more important given that the cost of tuition in private colleges is over 50,000 per year. 

In this paper explore how various college characteristics influence future student earnings and attempt to answer if students attending private colleges have an advantage in future earning over public colleges, or is the situation reversed given that students in public colleges have much lower student loans.
This project analyzes data from US department of education, which collets various data points on schools, admissions and tuition costs, student demographics financing and post education earnings. I will create a model capable of predicting future studentâ€™s earning based on the available data.
